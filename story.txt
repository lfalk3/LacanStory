Bob went to get himself a bowl of Fruit Loops, but realized he was out of milk. Bob then grabbed the next closest thing which was a bag of Whisps. There were 
only a few left and he needed to come up with something more to eat.
Bob eats like a maniac so he wanted asomething big to eat. He journeyed out of his home and into the world on a quest for food. He decided to explore the local cusine.
After wandering for a while, he fell upon a quaint little restaurant, he was so happy to finally be able to eat. But, upon enterring the restaurant, he found out that they were all out of food!! Little Bobby was now very worried that he may not ever get to eat food again. He was devastated. 
He is very sad, but hunger has made him lose his mind. He began to have hallucinations, and he felt that everything in the restaurant was made of candy. Finally, he ate all the chairs despite the bossâ€™s block.
